Application description: This Program takes inn Userinnput, then validates it according to what makes sense given a the input. The application does only need a email or phone number to work, but also works with both. After the inputs are validated they are sent to the H2 database via a post and a pojo. Its then inserted into the database by sql. This works the other way around when retreving the information from the database. its then formated to fitt the display table.
The data is beeing sorted just when the user wants to acces/retrive the data because it does not make a diffrence when its sorted in this program
